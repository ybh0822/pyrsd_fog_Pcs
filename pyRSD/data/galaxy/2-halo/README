The left panel of figure 4 shows the result for centrals,
P_{cc}^s(k,\mu)/(1+f\mu^2/b)^2 P_{cc}^r(k), that can be reproduced 
by the data "pkmu_s_r_c_c_00020_30000_z005_1-3_02-13aaan". It has 13 columns, as
follows. 

1st: k
2nd: P_{cc}^s(k,\mu=0.1)
3rd: its error
4th: P_{cc}^s(k,\mu=0.3)
5th: its error
...
10th: P_{cc}^s(k,\mu=0.9)
11th: its error
12th: P_{cc}^r(k)
13th: its error

The top row of figure 5 is the same as figure 4 but shows the results for
P_{c_As}, P_{c_A c_A}, and P_{c_A c_B} from the left. The corresponding data 
files are: 

P_{c_A s}: "pkmu_s_r_f_s_00020_30000_z005_1-3_02-13aaan"
P_{s_A s_A}: "pkmu_s_r_i_i_00020_30000_z005_1-3_02-13aaan"
P_{s_A s_B}: "pkmu_s_r_i_j_00020_30000_z005_1-3_02-13aaan"
There data format is the same as above. 

The top row of figure 7 shows the ratio of a spectrum divided by the same
spectrum with satellite positions and velocities replaced by those of the host
halos, by which we can isolate the Finger of God effect as a deviation from
unity. 

The numerators of the quantities at the top row of figure 7 are the same as
those at the top row of figure 5. The denominators are:

P_{c_A s}: "pkmu_s_f_v_00020_30000_z005_1-3_02-13aaan"
P_{s_A s_A}: "pkmu_s_w_w_00020_30000_z005_1-3_02-13aaan"
P_{s_A s_B}: "pkmu_s_w_z_00020_30000_z005_1-3_02-13aaan"

For them there are only 11 columns. For example, for P_{c_A s},
1st: k
2nd: P_{c_A s}^s(k,\mu=0.1)
3rd: its error
4th: P_{c_A s}^s(k,\mu=0.3)
5th: its error
...
10th: P_{c_A s}^s(k,\mu=0.9)
11th: its error

For shot noise that exists for the auto-correlation, I have already subtracted
it in the data assuming Poisson (see table 1 for number densities). If you need
the large-scale bias value b_1, please refer to table 1. But it is estimated
without introducing b_2. If you need to simultaneously determine b_1 and b_2, I
can send you the cross power spectrum with dark matter. Also if you need to use
the spectra without shot noise subtraction, please let me know.
